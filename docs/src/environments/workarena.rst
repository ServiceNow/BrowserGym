Usage
"""""

**Create a ServiceNow Developer Instance**

* Go to https://developer.servicenow.com/ and create an account.

* Click on Request an instance and select the Washington release (initializing the instance will take a few minutes)

* Once the instance is ready, you should see your instance URL and credentials. If not, click Return to the Developer Portal, then navigate to Manage instance password and click Reset instance password.

* You should now see your URL and credentials. Based on this information, set the following environment variables:

   * SNOW_INSTANCE_URL: The URL of your ServiceNow developer instance

   * SNOW_INSTANCE_UNAME: The username, should be "admin"

   * SNOW_INSTANCE_PWD: The password, make sure you place the value in quotes "" and be mindful of escaping special shell characters. Running echo $SNOW_INSTANCE_PWD should print the correct password.

* Log into your instance via a browser using the admin credentials. Close any popup that appears on the main screen (e.g., agreeing to analytics).
