## Install demo-agent

conda env create -f environment.yml

You will need an OpenAI API key to run the `run_demo.py` script.

## Modifying some content on a web page
Everything happens inside the `BrowserEnvEnhanced` class, located at browsergym/core/src/browsergym/core/env.py. This class implements a `alter_env` method, which replaces the content of elements matching a given selector. By default, it is set to `"div[id$='-comment-rtjson-content']"` , which is the selector for reddit comments. This replacement is made at reset time and and step time. Note that the replacement texts can be generated by an arbitrary method -by default fixed text.

## How it works
BrowserGym creates a gym environment that allows easy interaction with web pages. By modifying the webpage directly, the agent processes the web page and receives the a11tree and/or HTML and/or screenshots (by default a11tree).
